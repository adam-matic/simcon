    "the delay effects are nicely compensated, and the system reacts just as\n",
    "fast as a system without feedback could react. It also controls a great\n",
    "deal better when disturbances act on the controlled quantity than a\n",
    "system without feedback could control. Notice, by the way, that even\n",
    "though the time constant of the output function is 400 seconds, the time\n",
    "constant for restoration of the controlled quantity to its former value\n",
    "is only a few tenths of a second, following the lag. The overall dynamic\n",
