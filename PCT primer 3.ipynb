    "As you can see, there is essentially no change in the controlled quantity\n",
    "-- it still remains close to the reference setting of zero. If you look\n",
    "closely, you can see that the controlled quantity now remains closer to\n",
    "zero than before; the disturbance has even less effect on it. But the\n",
    "most striking change is that the output of the system now shows only half\n",
    "as much variation as the disturbance. Instead of two symmetrical\n",

    "The sixth line introduces the random generator. The basic generator\n",

    "This number is smoothed through a one, two, or three stage filter. In\n",
    "this example, we use a three stage filter with each stage having a time\n",
    "constant of 0.2 seconds. The output of the generator is represented by\n",

    "quantity, and the disturbing quantity.\n",
    "--------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "Run the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the symmetry seen in the previous plots is now gone. You will\n",
    "notice that one plot is missing: the perceptual signal and the controlled\n",
    "quantity now have the same numerical magnitude, so only one of them\n",
    "shows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important thing to notice is that the controlled quantity no\n",
    "longer stays near a fixed value. It is still controlled, but its value\n",
    "now tracks the reference signal's magnitude. Previously, the reference\n",
    "signal was constant at zero, so the controlled quantity remained almost\n",
    "constant at the same value. Now the reference signal is varying, and the\n",
    "controlled quantity is forced by the control action to undergo almost\n",
    "exactly the same variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reference signal and the perceptual signal now wander up and down in\n",
    "a smoothed random manner, almost together. This shows that the control\n",
    "system is still achieving its purpose: whatever the value of the\n",
    "reference signal, the control system makes its perceptual signal nearly\n",
    "the same in magnitude. Now, however, the symmetry between output and\n",
    "disturbance is almost gone. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can verify that the controlled quantity is still the sum of the\n",
    "output quantity and the disturbance in several easy ways. One is to look\n",
    "for the places where the disturbance magnitude crosses zero. At those\n",
    "places, the output quantity is equal to the controlled quantity, meaning\n",
    "that the output quantity trace crosses the controlled quantity trace just\n",
    "at that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the disturbance trace crosses zero, the state of the system is\n",
    "nearly -- not quite, but nearly -- the same as it would be if the\n",
    "disturbance were continuously at zero. In that case, the only influence\n",
    "available to keep the perceptual signal near the reference signal is the\n",
    "output quantity. All the factors between the output and the reference\n",
    "signal are 1.0, so it follows that the output quantity must be equal to\n",
    "the perceptual signal at those moments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way is to look for places where the disturbance trace crosses the\n",
    "output quantity trace. At such times, the two quantities are equal. The\n",
    "distance from the crossing point to the zero axis is then just half the\n",
    "distance of the controlled quantity from the zero axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This follows from the fact that the perceptual signal is the sum of the\n",
    "disturbance and output quantities, each weighted by 1.0. These quantities\n",
    "must always sum to the value of the perceptual signal, so when they are\n",
    "equal they must each be half the magnitude of the perceptual signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at any other times on the plot, you can see the momentary\n",
    "magnitudes of the disturbing quantity and the output quantity. They\n",
    "always add up to the magnitude of the perceptual signal, which you can\n",
    "verify, roughly, by eye. If the random reference signal ever crosses\n",
    "zero, you will see that at that instant, the disturbing quantity is equal\n",
    "to the controlled quantity; at that instant it is the sole influence\n",
    "keeping the controlled quantity at the reference signal's magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "         Effect of changing perceptual input factor\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can re-introduce the last change we used in the first version of\n",
    "this program. Change\n",

    "\n",
    "sp summator qc 2.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, we're now making the magnitude of the perceptual signal twice\n",
    "that of the controlled quantity. You know that the purpose of the system\n",
    "is to make the perceptual signal match the reference signal, now varying\n",
    "with time. Can you predict what the effect of the above change on the\n",
    "controlled quantity will be? Assume that the perceptual signal will still\n",
    "follow the reference signal. We have doubled the sensitivity of the input\n",
    "function of the system, giving the controlled quantity twice as much\n",
    "effect on the perceptual signal as before. What will happen? Run the\n",
    "program and see.\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens is that the variations in the controlled quantity are now\n",
    "half as large as the variations in the perceptual signal. That is, of\n",
    "course, what must happen if the perceptual signal is going to continue\n",
    "matching the value of the reference signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "                       An important note\n",
    "\n",
    "A control system keeps its perceptual signal at a value matching its\n",
    "reference signal. Many people, at first, understand this statement to\n",
    "mean that some particular value of the perceptual signal is brought about\n",
    "by the control action. But from the above demonstrations, you can see\n",
    "that this statement holds whether the reference signal is constant or\n",
    "varying. When we say that the control system controls its own perceptual\n",
    "signal, we're not talking about particular values of the signals, but\n",
    "about a relationship between signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same is true when we say that the output of the control system\n",
    "opposes the effects of disturbances. In saying this, we aren't referring\n",
    "to a particular amount of disturbance or output, but of a relationship\n",
    "between these quantities, whether they are constant or changing. In\n",
    "general, we don't know anything about the disturbing quantity's future\n",
    "variations; they are unpredictable. But we do know how the disturbance\n",
    "variations will be related to changes in the output and the controlled\n",
    "variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "We characterize the behavior of a control system not in terms of what it\n",
    "does when a particular disturbance occurs, or what happens when a\n",
    "particular value of reference signal is set, but about relationships\n",
    "among the magnitudes of the variables. These relationships hold true no\n",
    "matter what those variables happen to be doing. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is in contrast with traditional ways of characterizing behavior, in\n",
    "which specific environmental events are supposed to be followed by\n",
    "specified behavioral events. If event A happens, the organism will\n",
    "execute behavior B, or change its behavior in some typical way.  Under\n",
    "the control system model, we do not specify any specific environmental\n",
    "events. Instead, we speak of the way actions relate to variations in\n",
    "environmental variables, and how perceptions relate to variations in\n",
    "reference settings or goals. Because the model is based on relationships\n",
    "instead of events, it can predict behavior for any kind of change in the\n",
    "disturbing quantity or the reference signal. If a brief disturbance\n",
    "occurs, a brief change in output will occur. If the disturbance changes\n",
    "slowly and steadily, or remains constant for some time, so will the\n",
    "output of the system. If the goal changes briefly or varies continuously,\n",
    "so will the perceptual signal change. Specific events can be studied by\n",
    "applying specific finite patterns of disturbance, or specific finite\n",
    "variations in the reference signal. But the control model is basically\n",
    "about continuous general relationships, not about specific events.\n",
    "\n",
    "                     Two final exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "We have looked at the effects of varying the factor connecting the output\n",
    "quantity to the controlled quantity, and the controlled quantity to the\n",
    "perceptual signal. Two other features of the system remain: the factor\n",
    "connecting the disturbance to the controlled quantity, and the\n",
    "integration factor in the output function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Changing the contribution of the disturbing quantity to the controlled\n",
    "quantity can be done by changing the factor following qd in\n",
    "\n",
    "qc summator qo 1.0 qd 1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "See if you can predict the effects of changing the 1.0 first to 2.0 and\n",
    "then to 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "The factor in the output function determines how rapidly the output will\n",
    "change for a given amount of error. To change this, change the final\n",
    "factor in\n",
    "\n",
    "qo integrator 0.0 se 50.0\n",
    "\n",
    "If you make that final factor too large, you will see some computational\n",
    "artifacts; extremely high-frequency oscillations. If that occurs you can\n",
    "make the basic iteration interval in the \"time\" directive smaller until\n",
    "the oscillations disappear, or simply avoid using too large a value of\n",
    "the final factor in the above program line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting kind of change in the output function is to use an\n",
    "amplifier instead of an integrator. An amplifier's response to a positive\n",
    "step-input starts out like that of an integrator, a rising ramp. But\n",
    "where the integrator's output will just continue to rise as long as the\n",
    "input is steady, an amplifier's output will fall away from the rising\n",
    "ramp and level out at a value that is some constant times the input. How\n",
    "fast it will level out depends on the time constant given to the\n",
    "amplifier. Try substituting the following line for the integrator above:\n",
    "\n",
    "qo amplifier 0.0 se 50.0 2.0\n",
    "\n",
    "The second-to-last factor is the steady-state amplification, determining\n",
    "the value of qo after a long period of time, as a multiple of the steady\n",
    "value of se. The final factor is the time constant, in seconds, required\n",
    "for the output to rise 63 percent of the way to the final value after a\n",
    "step-change in the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will find that as long as the amplification factor is large enough\n",
    "and the time constant short enough, the control system's behavior is\n",
    "hardly affected at all by changes in the factors. This is in sharp\n",
    "contrast to the conventional model, in which a change in output\n",
    "characteristics would necessarily produce an equivalent change in\n",
    "observed behavior. In Primer 4 we will look at effects of nonlinearities\n",
    "and delays in control systems, and we will find that such factors in the\n",
    "output function still have only minor effects on behavior.\n",
