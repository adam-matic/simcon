    "     Introduction to perceptual control theory, Part II\n",
    "\n",
    "                     A simple control system\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of Part I we had a potentially-controlled variable that is\n",
    "affected both by a disturbing variable and an output variable. To build\n",
    "a control system that will stabilize the controlled variable against the\n",
    "disturbance, we require three components: a perceptual function, a\n",
    "comparison function or comparator, and an output function. We will add\n",
    "these to the simulation \"duckfan.inp\" one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the perceptual function. All that this function does is to convert\n",
    "from a physical variable in the environment to a signal representing that\n",
    "variable inside the control system. If this were a model of a person, the\n",
    "variable inside the system would be called a \"perception\" of the external\n",
    "variable. The units of the external velocity variable are mm/sec. The\n",
    "units of the signal representing it -- or any other external variable --\n",
    "would be impulses per second, because all information is carried in the\n",
    "nervous system as trains of impulses at varying frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can adopt a convention here: whatever the unit in which the external\n",
    "variable is measured, we will take the number of impulses per second that\n",
    "results from one unit of the external variable and call that one NSU, or\n",
    "\"nervous system unit.\" This means that the perceptual function needs no\n",
    "scaling factor: it can always be represented as a multiplier of 1, at\n",
    "least when we are dealing with a single control system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The perceptual function in our simulation is therefore exceedingly\n",
    "simple. Its input is the velocity of the duck, vel, and its output is a\n",
    "perceptual signal sp, equal in magnitude to vel. We can use a simple\n",
    "summator with only one input here, because we do not need the time\n",
    "constant that an amplifier would provide:\n",
    "\n",
    "sp summator vel 1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add that statement to duckfan.inp (right after the statement\n",
    "where vel is the output) and add sp to the list of plotted variables. We\n",
    "won't bother with the plot here, because sp will lie over or under vel\n",
    "in the plot. In fact, you can remove vel from the print list, because sp\n",
    "will always be exactly equal to it. In effect, the signal sp gives the\n",
    "control system a speedometer that indicates the velocity of the duck.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next, and possibly most critical, component of the control system is\n",
    "the comparator. The comparator receives two signals. One of them is the\n",
    "perceptual signal sp. The other is called the reference signal,\n",
    "symbolized sr. If you want the control system to maintain the velocity\n",
    "(and sp) at some specific value, you give this value to sr.\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparator function then subtracts the perceptual signal sp from the\n",
    "reference signal sr, and outputs an \"error signal\" symbolized se. The\n",
    "error signal is equal to the difference in magnitudes between sp and sr,\n",
    "with sp being subtracted from sr. So the error signal indicates by how\n",
    "much and in which direction the perceptual signal differs from the\n",
    "reference signal. Note that because we subtract the perceptual signal\n",
    "from the reference signal, we will get a NEGATIVE error when the\n",
    "perception is too large. Think of the sign of the error signal as\n",
    "indicating which way the output should change. If the perceptual signal\n",
    "is too large, giving a negative error, the output should become SMALLER.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our simulation, we need to specify a reference signal that has a\n",
    "value somewhere in the range of values of vel. As vel varies from 0 to\n",
    "100.0 in the simulation we have so far, we can pick sr = 100.0. We can\n",
    "set it with a \"const\" SIMCON function.\n",
    "\n",
    "SIMCON contains an explicit comparator function, called \"comparator.\" We\n",
    "can add the previous statement and a comparator function statement to the\n",
    "program from Part I:\n",

    "Explanation: As before, the disturbance is a ramp increasing with time,\n",
    "and the output variable is a negative pulse that starts at 2.0 seconds\n",
    "and ends at 4.0 seconds. We now have added the reference signal sr as a\n",
    "constant with a value of 50.0, and farther down, the perceptual signal\n",
    "which is simply equal to the velocity of the duck, vel, and the error\n",
    "signal, which is sr - sp. We have removed vel from the print list, and\n",
    "are now plotting the perceptual signal, the reference signal, the error\n",
    "signal, the output, and the disturbance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the \"plot\" statement now contains scaling factors. The first\n",
    "four are 1.0, but the last one is 0.1. This says we want to show the\n",
    "disturbance at one-tenth actual size. This will expand the scale of the\n",
    "remaining variables so they can be seen more easily. The plot as a whole\n",
    "always fits the plotting window.\n",
    "--------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have a rather confused plot, but by identifying each variable and\n",
    "following its plot, you can sort out what is happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, sr, the reference signal, is a straight line 50.0 units above the\n",
    "zero axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the disturbance is the ramp that starts at zero and continues up\n",
    "and to the right for the whole plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, the perceptual signal starts upward along with the disturbance,\n",
    "but at time 2.0 it abruptly goes downward. This occurs at the same time\n",
    "that the output variable executes its negative pulse of 100 units, which\n",
    "you can also see as a line at the VERY bottom of the plot from 2.0 sec\n",
    "to 4.0 sec.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the error signal se begins level with the reference signal and\n",
    "declines toward zero as the perceptual signal sp rises. Initially, the\n",
    "reference signal is 50.0 and the perceptual signal is 0.0, so the error\n",
    "signal is sr - sp or 50.0 units. As sp increases, the error signal\n",
    "decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the output does its sudden change, the perceptual signal suddenly\n",
    "becomes much smaller -- in fact, negative -- and the error signal rises\n",
    "higher than the reference signal. There is only one place on the plot\n",
    "where the error signal is actually zero, showing that the perceptual\n",
    "signal matches the reference signal. That point occurs just after the\n",
    "output goes back to zero, and the rising ramp disturbance finally brings\n",
    "the perceptual signal high enough to cross the reference signal line.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is clearly not a control system, but we are close to making it one\n",
    "no matter how confused the situation looks now. All that we need is to\n",
    "vary the output o, somehow, to make the perceptual signal match the\n",
    "reference signal all the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we add one more line to the simulation. We take the error\n",
    "signal e and multiply it by a gain factor, then make the output of the\n",
    "new block the output o. Then we can delete the line where the output\n",
    "signal was created as an arbitrary pulse. Also, two housekeeping lines\n",
    "are added."

    "Explanation: You will notice that to generate the output o from the error\n",
    "signal, we use a summator instead of an amplifier. In later parts of this\n",
    "series, we will see that to make the control system as stable as\n",
    "possible, we must have only one time constant in the whole loop. A\n",
    "summator has no time constant, but an amplifier does. We have used the\n",
    "time constant of an amplifier to simulate inertia of the duck; if we put\n",
    "another one into the loop, we would begin to see some instability. You\n",
    "can try it if you like, using the statement \"o amplifier se 0.0 40.0\n",
    "0.5\"). You'll find that you have to reduce the \"40.0\" a lot to get\n",
    "anything like stable operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beside adding the line with o as an output and deleting the original\n",
    "generator line near the start, we have added two new lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The line with output showo comes from a limit function, which takes\n",
    "o as an input, and passes it through to the output showo cut off at\n",
    "limits of -110 and +110. The reason is that at the very beginning, where\n",
    "there is a very large error signal, the output o momentarily becomes very\n",
    "large. The result is that when the plot is automatically scaled, the\n",
    "vertical dimension of all the other variables shrinks so they're\n",
    "difficult to see. You can plot o instead of showo and see the result for\n",
    "yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The \"group\" directive makes the functions whose outputs are listed\n",
    "compute simultaneously, during a single iteration. As we are building up\n",
    "a number of functions, each one of which represents a time-delay of 0.01\n",
    "sec, an unwanted delay would otherwise be introduced into the loop. We\n",
    "will examine the effects of delays later. For now, using this group\n",
    "directive we can reduce the delay in the control loop to 0.01 sec,\n",
    "assuring proper behavior.\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several important things to notice about this plot, which is\n",
    "much neater than the one just before it.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the perceptual signal rises almost to the level of the reference\n",
    "signal, and while the disturbance rises from 0 to 1000.0, deviates from\n",
    "the reference signal by only a small amount -- in fact, about 2.5%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the output signal rises quickly to a high value, then declines\n",
    "as the disturbance rises. The sum of the output effect and the disturbing\n",
    "effect maintains the perceptual signal, and the sensed velocity, very\n",
    "close to the reference signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, the error signal remains nearly zero throughout the run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fourth, the changes in the signals, which were fairly sloppy in the\n",
    "previous versions due to the half-second time constant in the response\n",
    "of the duck, have now become very brisk. The effective time constant of\n",
    "the whole system is now only a small fraction of the time constant we saw\n",
    "before.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the behavior of all the variables altered drastically as soon\n",
    "as we closed the feedback loop by letting the error signal determine the\n",
    "output o. Before we closed the loop, the disturbing variable d had a\n",
    "large effect on vel, the duck's velocity. The variable o at that time was\n",
    "just another disturbance, and it, too, had a large effect on vel. After\n",
    "we closed the loop, however, the disturbing variable's effect dropped\n",
    "almost to nothing, with the velocity being determined almost completely\n",
    "by the reference signal. The output variable o, now being determined by\n",
    "the control system, varied just as it needed to vary to prevent the\n",
    "disturbance from affecting the velocity. And the error signal all but\n",
    "disappeared (but not quite -- it is what is making this system work).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let's prove that the reference signal and not the disturbance\n",
    "now determines the velocity of the duck. Instead of using a constant\n",
    "reference signal, we'll construct one that starts at + 50 units as\n",
    "before, then in the middle of the run drops to 25 units, then returns to\n",
    "50 again.\n",

    "Now it's clear that the perceptual signal, and the duck's velocity which\n",
    "is equal to it, follow the changes in the reference signal almost\n",
    "perfectly. The velocity pattern does not resemble the disturbance pattern\n",
    "at all. By setting the reference signal to any particular value, you make\n",
    "the control system maintain the duck's velocity at that same value,\n",
    "exactly the principle of a cruise control in a car.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of the reference signal can be described as the intended or\n",
    "desired value of the controlled variable. This system wants the duck's\n",
    "velocity to become +50 mm/sec, then +25, then +50 again. It acts on its\n",
    "environment, adding its output to the disturbance which is also affecting\n",
    "the duck's velocity, so that the actual perceived velocity remains near\n",
    "the desired value, even when the desired value changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reference signal is a standard against which the perceived velocity\n",
    "is compared. It specifies a purpose for the actions of the control\n",
    "system. The purpose is a state of the perceived variable, not of the\n",
    "action, the output. The output automatically adjusts to be whatever it\n",
    "must be to cancel the effects of the disturbing variable, and at the same\n",
    "time bring the perceptual variable to the intended state. So this model\n",
    "explains how purposes, intentions, desires, and other similar terms fit\n",
    "into a physical model of nervous system function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the writeup of SIMCON there is a demonstration program that produces\n",
    "a sine wave and a cosine wave. You might like to incorporate that program\n",
    "into duckfan, as a reference signal or as a disturbance or both, to see\n",
    "the effects. This same control system will automatically alter its output\n",
    "to counteract ANY waveform of disturbance, or any sum of waveforms.\n",
