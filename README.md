# simcon
Analog computer simulator in python

It is just textual input though. Textual input to analog computer simulators is not very convenient. You have to draw diagrams on paper first, then write the equations on paper, then enter the text describing the equations. It is a pain if you weren't already trained. Nodes and dragging stuff is better. I guess. So, some visual interface for modifying parameters and diagrams is necessary, anything is better than text.

The solver seems to work on simple problems, like a half dozen elements (functions), needs more testing. Trying to learn enough javascript for the visual editor.
