    "Many control processes in an organism involve controlled variables that\n",

    "generally choose to eat foods that are \"palatable.\" There is no chemical\n",
    "or physical test that can be applied to food that will reveal its\n",
    "palatability. Palatability is a perception inside the organism.\n",
    "Furthermore, many different foods are palatable; if one kind of food is\n",
    "not available, another will do as well as far as palatability is\n",
    "concerned. The fact that an organism eats one food and not another does\n",
    "not mean that the other is not palatable; it means only that other\n",
    "factors have come into play which make control of palatability the\n",
    "easiest through choosing one food instead of the other. In many cases,\n",
    "no choice has to be made; the organism eats a little of this and a little\n",
    "of that.\n",

    "The effective controlled variable that corresponds to a perceptual signal\n",
    "inside a control system is generally a function of many more detailed\n",

    "\n",
    "The duration of the run is 50 seconds, a single iteration representing\n",
    "0.1 second.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two disturbance generators. The first generates a triangular\n",
    "wave with an amplitude of 50 and a peak at time 10. The second generates\n",
    "a similar triangular wave with a peak at time 40. The two disturbances\n",
    "are separated in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two physical quantities, qp1 and qp1, result from adding the output\n",
    "of the control system, qo, weighted by 1, to either qd1 or qd2, also\n",
    "weighted by 1. So each physical quantity is separately disturbed, but is\n",
    "affected by the system's output quantity in exactly the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The perceptual signal sp results from sensing qp1 with a weight of 1 and\n",
    "qp2 with a weight of 2 and adding the effects with a summator. So the\n",
    "same perceptual signal can be generated by n units of qp1 or by n/2 units\n",
    "of qp2, or by combinations of qp1 and 2*qp2 that add up to the same value\n",
    "of the perceptual signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The perceptual signal is compared against a reference signal that is\n",
    "produced by a ramp generator. The reference signal starts at 0 and\n",
    "increases uniformly to 20 units at the end of the run.\n",
    "\n",
    "The error signal coming out of the comparator enters an amplifier with\n",
    "a gain of 200 and a time constant of 80 seconds, the output initialized\n",
    "to 0.\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "Run the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reference ramp sr is a diagonal line. Closely following it is the\n",
    "perceptual signal sp. At time 1, a disturance qd1 starts to affect qp1\n",
    "in the positive direction. As you can see, it does cause qp1 to change.\n",
    "This tends to drive the perceptual signal slightly above the reference\n",
    "signal, as the sp trace shows, but this produces a negative-going error\n",
    "which drives the output qo in the negative direction. The negative going\n",
    "output partially compensates for the effect of the disturbance on qp1 and\n",
    "thus on the perceptual signal, but it also drives qp2 negative. The\n",
    "negative effect on qp2 acts to further reduce the effect of the\n",
    "disturbance on the perceptual signal. These two effects of the output,\n",
    "one acting through qp1 and the other through qp2, together prevent any\n",
    "material increase in the perceptual signal above the momentary value of\n",
    "the reference signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still considering just the first disturbing event, we can see that a\n",
    "disturbance which increases the amount of qp1 is compensated by a\n",
    "decrease in qp2. If you reverse the effect of qd1 (by changing its weight\n",
    "to -1 in the summator that produces sp), the opposite effect will occur;\n",
    "the decrease in qp1 will be compensated by an increase in qp2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second disturbing event, starting at time 30, acts on qp2 alone. Now\n",
    "the effect on qp2 is compensated by an opposite effect on qp1. The weight\n",
    "of qp2 is twice that of qp1; disturbing qp2 thus causes a somewhat larger\n",
    "error than disturbing qp1. When qp2 is disturbed, qp1 changes more than\n",
    "qp2 does; when qp1 is disturbed, the same is true. In both cases, qp2\n",
    "changes just half as much as qp1 changes. This is true strictly because\n",
    "of the 2-to-1 ratio of the perceptual input weightings. If you change\n",
    "that ratio to 1:1, the disturbances will cause qp1 and qp2 to change\n",
    "equally (and oppositely). If you set the weight of qp1 to 2 and the\n",
    "weight of qp2 to 1, the 2:1 ratio will reverse. The output is affecting\n",
    "both qp1 and qp2 equally in every case; the relative amounts of change\n",
    "are determined completely by the weightings at the input to the\n",
    "perceptual function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The appearance of these responses to disturbances is deceiving. It would\n",
    "seem that the system detects which physical variable is being disturbed,\n",
    "and responds by altering the other one to compensate. But there is no\n",
    "such logic in this system. The output affects both physical quantities\n",
    "at all times by the same amount and in the same direction. It is only the\n",
    "interaction of the output with the disturbances that leads to the effect\n",
    "we observe.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all cases, of course, the perceptual signal is affected only slightly\n",
    "by the disturbances. The main effect on the perceptual signal, by far,\n",
    "is that of the reference signal. If you change the reference signal\n",
    "generator to a random function, you will see that the perceptual signal\n",
    "still follows it. Of course the behavior of qp1 and qp2 will be modified\n",
    "accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This control system is controlling an abstract aspect of the environment.\n",
    "It is maintaining a function of qp1 and qp2 at a specified reference\n",

    "constructs a perception composed of a*qp1 + b*qp2, where a and b are the\n",
    "same weights that the behaving system's perceptual function is applying.\n",
