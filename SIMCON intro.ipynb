    "SIMCON is an analogue computer implemented on a digital computer. It\n",
    "enables the user to connect functional blocks to each other and assign\n",
    "parameters to the inputs and internal operations of the blocks, then\n",
    "run the simulation and plot the results. The output of each block is\n",
    "designated by a user-assignable name, and plots can be made of any\n",
    "named variable. Plots are globally scaled to fit the largest\n",
    "excursions of variables into the plotting area; in addition, relative\n",
    "scales can be assigned to each variable individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program setup is contained in a user-written text file with the\n",
    "extension \".inp\". This text file can be sent over network\n",
    "communications so that users can pass setups to each other and run\n",
    "them.\n",
    "\n",
    "A small user-written text file named simcon.rc enables the user to\n",
    "integrate a text editor into the program so that the program file can\n",
    "be edited without leaving Simcon. The same file can specify that the\n",
    "plots be done using gnuplot3.exe (which the user must have); if the\n",
    "line specifying gnuplot is left out, a built-in plotting routine is\n",
    "used. If there is no file simcon.rc, the program will simply exit\n",
    "after doing a plot, and the user can use any convenient means of\n",
    "editing the program listing, then restart Simcon.\n",
    "The C source code of SIMCON is ANSI compatible with the exception of\n",
    "the built-in plotting routines. By using the provision for linking to\n",
    "Gnuplot, it should be possible to port the program to Unix and other\n",

    "a subtle feature of Simcon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simcon is actually a parallel computing device. All block computations\n",
    "are done, in effect, at the same time -- not in sequence. For eachblock having an input and an output, the inputs are used to calculate\n",
    "a new output; this is done for all blocks on any one iteration of the\n",
    "program. Each block, however, is taking as inputs the OLD outputs from\n",
    "the other blocks to which it is connected. So in effect, all the\n",
    "computations occur simultaneously. Then, when all computations are\n",
    "finished for one iteration, all the \"new\" outputs are copied into the\n",
    "\"old\" outputs in preparation for the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, a change at the input to a block takes one iteration to\n",
    "show up as an effect on the output of that block. However, if there\n",
    "are several blocks connected in sequence, as there usually are, a\n",
    "change at the input to the first block doesn't reach the output of the\n",
    "nth block until n iterations later. Although all blocks are acting\n",
    "simultaneously, there are transport lags (like neural conduction times\n",
    "or synaptic delays) in every element. This allows the simulation to\n",
    "deal realistically with lags in the system, without forcing the\n",
    "computing functions to \"take turns acting\" (a common mistake in\n",
    "analyzing systems with delays).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the MINIMUM lag possible is the time \"dt\" that specifies the\n",
    "duration of one iteration of the program. Longer lags can be inserted\n",
    "anywhere by using a DELAY block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to the GROUP directive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes the user will wish to create a complex block by combining\n",
    "several blocks. Also, there are cases (as in modeling the acceleration\n",
    "and velocity of masses in the environment) where transport lags should\n",
    "be as small as possible (they can't be smaller than one iteration, of\n",
    "course). In either case, the user does NOT want to have as many\n",
    "transport lags as there are elements being combined, but wants the\n",
    "group of elements to pass its inputs to its outputs as fast as\n",
    "possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what the GROUP directive is for.\n",
    "\n",
    "GROUP:\n",
    "\n",
    " Syntax: GROUP < list of names of block outputs>\n",
    "\n",
    " The group directive causes the NEW outputs of each block in the group\n",
    " to be used as input to the next block instead of the OLD outputs. As\n",
    " a result, an input to the first block in a group has an effect on the\n",
    " output of the last block in a single iteration of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    " Simcon automatically computes the dependencies within a group so that\n",
    " the computations are done in the correct order for minimum lag.\n",
    "\n",
    " There can be up to 10 GROUP directives, each on a separate line of\n",
    " the program listing. The groupings are independent of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "                         LEARNING TO USE SIMCON\n",
    "\n",
    "SIMCON does not yet allow drawing block diagrams of computing setups,\n",
    "so it is a good idea to draw your own diagram on paper first. Labelthe block outputs with short symbols that will remind you of their\n",
    "meaning, and label any weighted inputs with the weighting factors that\n",
    "go with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because SIMCON emulates an analogue computer, you must get used to the\n",
    "idea that all parts of a diagrammed setup are active at the same time.\n",
    "Each block is continuously converting its inputs to an output\n",
    "regardless of what other blocks are doing. A computing setup behaves\n",
    "as a whole; it can sometimes be hard to grasp what is going on because\n",
    "ordinary sequential cause and effect do not apply in the way to which\n",
    "you may be accustomed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In choosing a basic computing interval, remember that this sets the\n",
    "basic delay of a signal going through a block. If you have five blocks\n",
    "connected in sequence, a perturbation at the input of the first block\n",
    "will take 5 iterations of the program, five times the interval dt\n",
    "specified in the TIME directive, to reach the output of the last block\n",
    "in sequence. If you mean for this amount of delay to exist, all is\n",
    "well. Otherwise you may want to use the GROUP directive to make the\n",
    "delay equal to one iteration, the shortest possible. In general you\n",
    "will want to make dt short enough so that grouping will make the delay\n",
    "negligible on the time scale of the modeled system's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, as mentioned, the blocks in SIMCON act at the same time, so\n",
    "you can write the program lines defining the blocks and their\n",
    "connections in any order. This means you can collect sets of blocks\n",
    "together for ease of understanding instead of having to list the\n",
    "blocks in the order of connection. Comment lines (any part of a line\n",
    "following a \"#\" symbol) can be used to make the program more self-\n",
    "explanatory, so you can remember what a setup was supposed to do six\n",
    "months after you wrote it. Copious comments are especially useful to\n",
    "anyone else who wants to try your computing setup. The setup programs\n",
    "are pure ASCII files, so you can send them over a network like\n",
    "Compuserve or the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "                    Writing a SIMCON program\n",

    "SIMCON programs can be written using any text editor. However, if you\n",
