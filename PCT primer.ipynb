    "                        Introduction: PCT\n",
    "\n",
    "Perceptual control theory (PCT) is a theory of human and animal behavior\n",
    "based on engineering control theory. Engineering control theory, when\n",
    "developed during the 1930s, arose from an attempt to build machines that\n",
    "could duplicate human behavior in tasks that could not be done by\n",
    "ordinary machines because the actions required at any moment could not\n",
    "be predicted. \n",
    "\n",
    "These were control tasks. They required the human being to act on the\n",
    "environment in such a way that some aspect of the environment (like\n",
    "temperature or speed) was held constant, or was varied in some desired\n",
    "arbitrary way, despite unpredictable disturbances whose causes could\n",
    "neither be anticipated nor sensed. This kind of behavior differed from\n",
    "the kind studied in the conventional sciences of behavior. Instead of the\n",
    "behavior itself, the actions of the person, being generated in some\n",
    "particular pattern, affected something else in the environment and that\n",
    "something else was controlled. Hence we call that \"something else\" a\n",
    "controlled variable: variable because it is inherently capable of\n",
    "variation, and controlled because the person acts on it to prevent\n",
    "unwanted variations. Because controlled variables are in general subject\n",
    "to unpredictable disturbances, the actions required to control them are\n",
    "also unpredictable. The organization called a control system can produce\n",
    "actions in just that way.\n",
    "\n",
    "A familiar example can be found in steering a car. The actions of the\n",
    "driver consist of turning the steering wheel by applying forces to it\n",
    "with the arms and hands. These actions, in the terms of conventional\n",
    "sciences of life, are the \"behavior\" of the driver. But these actions\n",
    "affect something outside the driver, in the environment: the position of\n",
    "the car on the road. As the car moves along, it is disturbed in many\n",
    "ways. The roadbed has bumps in it and it tilts by different amounts.\n",
    "Winds push the car to one side or another. The car itself might have\n",
    "small defects like a soft tire or a tight wheel bearing, or its wheels\n",
    "might be slightly out of alignment. All these sources of disturbance act\n",
    "at the same time and tend to make the car veer to one side or the other\n",
    "by varying and unpredictable amounts. There is no way to sort out one\n",
    "cause of a disturbance from another; only the sum of all the varying\n",
    "disturbing influences causes the car to change course.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the disturbances is the angle of the front wheels of the car. That\n",
    "one disturbance, out of all those present, is affected by the driver's\n",
    "steering actions. When we see a car going in a straight line down the\n",
    "proper lane of a road, we can therefore deduce a simple fact: the\n",
    "disturbance of the car caused by the driver's steering actions must be\n",
    "equal and opposite at all times to the sum of all the other disturbing\n",
    "effects on the car's path. If for a moment the sum of those other effects\n",
    "is zero, the driver's steering effort must be zero at that moment. If the\n",
    "other effects are nonzero, the driver's effort is also nonzero by the\n",
    "same amount and in the opposite direction, as translated into an angle\n",
    "of the front wheels and thus a force on the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the controlled variable is the position of the car on\n",
    "the road. We say it is controlled by the driver because the driver's\n",
    "steering efforts prevent all the other disturbances from having their\n",
    "normal effects. But there is more to control than that. Not only can the\n",
    "driver cancel out disturbances of the controlled variable, but the driver\n",
    "can arbitrarily decide to bring the car to a new position on the road and\n",
    "hold it there, or even to make the car follow a particular desired\n",
    "pattern of side-to-side movements, still while preventing the other\n",
    "disturbances from causing any unwanted deviations from the desired path.\n",
    "When control is happening, the controlled variable becomes subject to the\n",
    "driver's intentions, and ceases to be subject to the environmental\n",
    "influences that normally affect it. If it were not for control, driving\n",
    "a car would be a dangerous business.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCT is a theory that explains how a human being or an animal could\n",
    "possibly act in such a way as to control something in its environment.\n",
    "The question of how control works takes us along a path that deviates\n",
    "more and more from conventional concepts of behavioral organization. We\n",
    "are forced to ask how the driver knows when to respond and when not to\n",
    "respond; we must ask how the driver knows when the car is in the right\n",
    "place, and how that \"mental\" knowledge can have a physical effect on the\n",
    "driver's actions. We have to face questions that conventional sciences\n",
    "long ago dismissed as unscientific: what is a desire, or an intention,\n",
    "or a purpose? Only in very recent times have these questions reappeared\n",
    "in polite scientific discourse -- yet the answer to them has been\n",
    "available for 60 years. The answer is to be found in control theory, and\n",
    "more explictly in PCT, which is an adaptation of engineering control\n",
    "theory to the particular relationship that holds between any organism and\n",
    "its environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will reach the basic explanation of control behavior quite soon, but\n",
    "first we must lay some groundwork. Few readers will be familiar with\n",
    "analog computers and they way they are used to simulate physical systems.\n",
    "We must introduce some basics first, sticking to those that we need here.\n",
    "We'll begin by seeing how we simulate the environment of a control\n",
    "system.\n",
    "\n",
    "                 Simulating the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an ambitious concept, considering what exists in \"the\n",
    "environment.\" We are not, however, going to simulate everything since the\n",
    "Big Bang, but only the aspect of the environment with which a control\n",
    "system is immediately interacting. This boils down to simulating a\n",
    "controlled variable and a disturbing variable that acts on the controlled\n",
    "variable. The controlled variable won't really be controlled until we add\n",
    "the control system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please be patient with the pace of the following development. The purpose\n",
    "is mostly to show by example how SIMCON is used, and how analog computer\n",
    "setups (\"programs\") are generated and their results plotted and\n",
    "interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just to tie this to a physical situation, let's suppose that the\n",
    "controlled variable is something about a bright yellow rubber duck\n",
    "costing $1.79 floating in the middle of a backyard swimming pool's\n",
    "swimming pool. The duck bobs up and down a little; its feet are 4.5 cm.\n",
    "below the surface of the water. There are obviously many things about\n",
    "this duck that might be of interest, but to find a controlled variable\n",
    "we must find something about that duck that can VARY. We will pick just\n",
    "one possible variable: its velocity. Not only that, we will narrow the\n",
    "variable even further, to its velocity in the east-west direction,\n",
    "ignoring any north-south or up-down component of velocity. We will call\n",
    "this velocity \"vel\". That is the only aspect of the yellow rubber duck\n",
    "that is of any interest now, so we can represent the whole state of the\n",
    "duck with a single number: vel. Right at the moment vel = 0. That means\n",
    "that the duck is not moving in the east-west direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now for the disturbing variable. The disturbing variable must be\n",
    "definable independently, without knowing what it is disturbing. The same\n",
    "disturbing variable might disturb a number of other physical variables\n",
    "in different ways depending on its physical connection to them. Our\n",
    "disturbing influence for present purposes is a 12-inch fan costing\n",
    "$12.50, with a variable-speed control, plugged into an extension cord\n",
    "running from the house into the back yard. Of all the aspects of the fan\n",
    "we might be interested in, the variable we will pick here will be the\n",
    "rotational speed of its blades. That is the disturbing variable, to which\n",
    "we refer by the symbol d. If d = 0, the blades are stationary. The larger\n",
    "d is, the faster the blades are spinning. If d goes negative, the blades\n",
    "are spinning the other way.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have picked out of the mass of details about the $1.79 rubber duck\n",
    "and the $12.50 fan just two variables: vel, the duck's velocity in the\n",
    "east-west direction, and d, the speed of rotation of the fan blades. From\n",
    "now on, vel represents the duck and d represents the fan. This is the\n",
    "first step in any simulation of a real system: going from a vague\n",
    "description of irrelevant things in the environment to a specification\n",
    "of variables. The trick is to pick variables that tell us something\n",
    "useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "We set the fan up east of the duck and turn it on, aiming it at the duck.\n",
    "As we increase the setting of the fan's speed control, the blades spin\n",
    "faster (d increases) and the air velocity near the duck increases. This\n",
    "causes a force on the duck, which begins to move downwind. It takes the\n",
    "duck a little while to reach its final velocity, a few tenths of a\n",
    "second. Then it moves at a steady velocity at which the water drag equals\n",
    "the force from the wind on it. If we turn up the fan's speed, the duck\n",
    "moves through the water faster. So vel depends on d. Now the question is,\n",
    "HOW does vel depend on d?\n",
    "\n",
    "With hours of rigorous experimentation, we arrive at some very\n",
    "encouraging results: the duck's velocity is proportional to the speed of\n",
    "the fan blades! This means we can use a simple equation to deduce the\n",
    "speed of the duck from knowing the speed of the fan blades, assuming\n",
    "nothing else is pushing on the duck. At 100 RPM the duck moves 10 mm per\n",
    "second; at 1000 RPM the duck moves 100 mm per second. So if we measure\n",
    "d (the fan blade speed) in RPM and vel (the duck's westerly speed) in mm\n",
    "per second, we find that\n",
    "\n",
    "vel = 0.1*d\n",
    "\n",
    "In case you haven't figured it out, the * means multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can use SIMCON to simulate this part of the environment."
